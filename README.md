Posture Recognition and Correction using OpenPose in Python
Project Title : Posture Recognition and Correction in an active Training Scenario

Project Authors : Vibhav Hosahalli Venkataramaiah,Varadaraya G Shenoy, Vignesh S P

Description :

In any sport or weight training session, the posture maintained by the person is most important, not only to ensure that the person performs his best, but also to ensure their safety. This is not usually a concern when the person trains under a trained professional, who ensures that the person is maintaining the correct posture. But in a self-taught session, the person training who in most cases is an amateur may end up severely injuring himself. In this project we aim to develop a platform that checks if the person training is maintaining the correct posture, and in case he is not doing so, provide the necessary corrections. This platform should be able to detect the current posture of the person of interest in the video and provide the steps necessary for correcting his/her posture, if and when it is improper. This platform provides much needed feedback to ensure that the person maintains the required posture, so that one gets the desired results while ensuring his/her safety. Currently, this platform is able to provide correction to 5 different postures namely squat,deadlift,lunge,glute bridge and plank.

Contents :

Codes - This folder consists of the different codes for different exercise scenarios.It also includes the input videos and a folder ('poses') which contains the prototext and caffemodel of the vector building models. Input Videos - Videos of postures Output Videos - Videos of postures with skeletal build Results

System Requirements:

2GB Hard Disk Space Quad Core Processor 8GB RAM Optional: 4GB Grapics Processing Unit(For faster results)

Installation :

Tried and Tested on Spyder platform (Python 3.6) - It should work for any Python shell of version 3.x OpenCV NumPy Matplotlib time math

Usage :

The codes section contains 5 codes for the 5 different postures along with the input videos. It is also necessary to include the 'pose' folder which consists of the prototext file and caffemodel of the vector building models in the same location as the codes. For new inputs of the aforementioned poses, the name of the new video has to be put in line 29 of that particular code.
